# Data Analysis Project

This project contains various data analysis exercises using real-world datasets, covering key techniques such as **linear regression**, **decision trees**, and **random forest models**.

🧪 Originally developed as a final project for a data analysis course, it focuses on building and evaluating models using Python, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks.
